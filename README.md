# 🚀 Claude Code Chat - VS Code Extension Website

Welcome to the official website for the **Claude Code Chat** VS Code extension!

🌐 **Website:** [https://claudecode.chat](https://claudecode.chat)

## 🤔 Why This Website?

While the VS Code extension marketplace is great, we created **ClaudeCode.Chat** to provide a richer, more accessible hub for our community:

1.  **🌐 Enhanced Multi-language Support:**
    *   The VS Code Marketplace page has limited localization. Our website offers a **comprehensive multi-language experience** (English, 中文, 日本語, Français, Deutsch, Español, Português, Русский, 한국어, Italiano).
    *   This ensures developers worldwide can understand the extension's powerful features easily.

2.  **✨ Visually Stunning Presentation:**
    *   We believe a tool as powerful as Claude Code Chat deserves a presentation that matches its capabilities.
    *   Our website provides a **more beautiful, engaging, and interactive visual showcase** than the standard marketplace page, highlighting features like the Chat Interface, Checkpoint System, MCP Server Management, and more through dedicated sections and examples.

3.  **🌱 A Growing Ecosystem Hub (Future):**
    *   This website is the foundation for a more extensive ecosystem around Claude Code Chat.
    *   **Planned additions include:**
        *   **Detailed Tutorials & Guides:** Step-by-step instructions and best practices.
        *   **Community Resources:** A place for users to share tips, tricks, and custom configurations.
        *   **Video Content:** Demonstrations and walkthroughs.
        *   **Blog/News:** Updates on new features, releases, and insights.
        *   **FAQ & Troubleshooting:** Centralized help resources.
